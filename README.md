## Development Journey

This app was created as part of the Swift Student Challenge 2025. It was developed in an intensive 2-3 day period, inspired by my experiences as an AFAD volunteer (Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority) following the 2023 earthquakes.

As a Basic AFAD Volunteer for over a year, I've witnessed firsthand the importance of proper disaster education, especially for children who are often the most vulnerable during natural disasters. This experience fueled my passion to create an accessible tool that turns critical safety knowledge into an engaging learning experience.

## Future Plans

Future updates will include:
- Additional disaster scenarios
- Personalized family emergency plans
- Multilingual support for global accessibility
- AR components for immersive training
- Integration with official emergency services information

## About the Developer

I'm passionate about leveraging technology to create positive social impact. Beyond this project:

- **AFAD Volunteer**: Contributing to disaster response and community preparedness initiatives
- **App Developer**: Creator of "Haydi: Smart Task Manager" and "AIBebek" on the App Store
- **Community Focus**: Dedicated to creating solutions for vulnerable populations, especially children
